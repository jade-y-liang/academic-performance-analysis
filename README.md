# Academic Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my final coursework in Stats 101A at UCLA. The goal was to predict students' academic performance indices using a dataset of 10,000 entries from Kaggle. This analysis is crucial for understanding the factors that influence academic success and can help educators tailor their approaches.

## Data Source
The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression). Prior to analysis, data cleaning and preprocessing were conducted to ensure accuracy and relevance of the results.

## Methods
I played a key role in fine-tuning a multiple linear regression model to predict students' academic performance. Our approach involved rigorous examination of diagnostic plots to identify any outliers and anomalies. We applied power transformations to stabilize variance and enhance the modelâ€™s ability to meet linear regression assumptions. Additionally, variable selection techniques were employed to identify the most significant predictors which included hours studied, previous scores, sleep hours, and the number of sample question papers practiced. These steps significantly improved the predictive accuracy and interpretability of our model.
